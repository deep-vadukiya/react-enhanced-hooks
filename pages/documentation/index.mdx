# React Enhanced Hooks

Welcome to **React Enhanced Hooks**, a modern collection of reusable, efficient, and developer-friendly custom hooks for React.js. This library provides easy-to-use hooks that address common challenges developers face when building React applications. From managing local storage to handling API requests and optimizing performance, React Enhanced Hooks aims to simplify complex React patterns.

## Why Use React Enhanced Hooks?

React hooks have revolutionized how we manage state and side effects in React applications. However, many scenarios require repetitive boilerplate code or can lead to complicated logic. That‚Äôs where **React Enhanced Hooks** comes in‚Äîproviding well-crafted, reusable hooks that are:

- **Efficient**: Hooks are optimized to minimize unnecessary re-renders, improving application performance.
- **Modular**: Import only the hooks you need to keep your bundle sizes small and efficient.
- **Simple API**: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Just import the hook and start using it with minimal setup.
- **TypeScript Support**: Each hook comes with TypeScript typings, allowing for better developer experience, autocomplete, and type safety.

## Key Features

- üì¶ **Ready-to-use**: Start using it right away in your React applications.
- üî• **Customizable**: Adapt hooks to your use cases with flexible configurations.
- üåê **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript types for better developer tooling and error handling.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Well-documented**: Full documentation and examples to guide you through integrating these hooks into your projects.
- üí° **Lightweight**: Import only the hooks you need, reducing your project's bundle size.
- üöÄ **Performant**: Designed to minimize performance overhead with optimized logic for React state management.

## Core Hooks

Here are a few of the popular hooks available in this library:

- **`useLocalStorage`**: Simplifies managing local storage in React.
- **`useFetch`**: A flexible data-fetching hook that supports error handling and loading states.
- **`useToggle`**: Easy toggle states between two values (e.g., true/false).
- **`useDebounce`**: Debounce any value or function execution with a custom delay.

Explore the full documentation to dive deeper into how to use each of these hooks. These hooks are designed to enhance productivity and make your code cleaner and more maintainable.
