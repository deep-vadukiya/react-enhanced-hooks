# `useOnlineStatus` Hook

The `useOnlineStatus` hook helps you easily detect the user's network connectivity status in a React component. It tracks whether the user is currently online or offline and updates the status in real-time, allowing you to respond to connectivity changes in your application.

## Usage

To use the `useOnlineStatus` hook, simply import it from the `react-enhanced-hooks` package and use it in your component to check the user's current network status.

### Example: Checking Online Status

Below is an example of how to use the `useOnlineStatus` hook to display a message indicating whether the user is currently online or offline:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useOnlineStatus } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You are currently {isOnline ? "online" : "offline"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## How It Works

- **isOnline**: The `useOnlineStatus` hook returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`) that represents the user's online status.
  - If the user is connected to the internet, `isOnline` will be `true`.
  - If the user loses connectivity or goes offline, `isOnline` will be `false`.

This value automatically updates in real-time, ensuring that your UI always reflects the latest connectivity status.

## Hook Signature

```js copy
const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
```

**Returns**: A boolean value representing whether the user is currently online (`true`) or offline (`false`).

## Key Features

- **Real-time Connectivity**: Automatically updates the online/offline status as the network connection changes.
- **Simple Usage**: Provides a straightforward boolean value to use in your UI.
- **Global Event Listener**: Under the hood, this hook listens to the `window` events like `online` and `offline` to track the user's connectivity.

## Full Example

In a more advanced scenario, you might want to conditionally show some UI elements based on the user's connectivity, such as disabling features that require an internet connection.

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useOnlineStatus } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You are currently {isOnline ? "online" : "offline"}</p>
      {!isOnline && <p>Some features may be unavailable while offline.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, if the user is offline, an additional message warns them that some features may be unavailable. You can use this hook to build a better user experience for offline handling.

## Browser Support

The `useOnlineStatus` hook works across modern browsers, which support the `navigator.onLine` property and the `online`/`offline` events. Be sure to test for compatibility if your app targets older browsers.
