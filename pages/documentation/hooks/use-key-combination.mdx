# `useKeyCombination` Hook

The `useKeyCombination` hook allows you to detect when a specific key is pressed in combination with `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd` on macOS. This is useful for keyboard shortcuts and improving user interactivity with keyboard combinations.

## Features

- Detects `Ctrl + key` combination on Windows and Linux.
- Detects `Cmd + key` combination on macOS.
- Works with any custom key specified by the developer.
- Automatically adapts to the user's operating system.

## Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the useKeyCombination hook in your project:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useKeyCombination } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const isCombinationPressed = useKeyCombination("/");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {isCombinationPressed
          ? 'Ctrl/Cmd + "/" combination pressed'
          : 'Press Ctrl/Cmd + "/" to trigger'}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Parameters

- **key1**: The key that should be combined with `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd` on macOS. It should be a string representing a valid keyboard key, such as `'a'`, `'b'`, `'Enter'`, etc.
- **Return Value**: The hook returns a boolean that indicates whether the key combination is currently being pressed (`true`) or not (`false`).

## Example

Hereâ€™s how the hook works:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useKeyCombination } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const isCombinationPressed = useKeyCombination("s"); // Detects Ctrl + S or Cmd + S

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {isCombinationPressed ? "Save command activated" : "Press Ctrl/Cmd + S"}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the state changes to true whenever the user presses `Ctrl + S` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (on macOS). This can be used to trigger custom functionality, such as saving a document or triggering a hotkey.

## How It Works

The `useKeyCombination` hook internally detects the operating system using the `navigator.userAgent` and adapts the control key accordingly: - On macOS, it uses the `Cmd` key (`metaKey` in JavaScript). - On Windows/Linux, it uses the `Ctrl` key (`ctrlKey` in JavaScript).
When the desired key is pressed along with the appropriate control key (`Ctrl` or `Cmd`), the state `isCombinationPressed` is set to `true`.

### Cleanup

The event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` are automatically added when the hook is initialized, and removed when the component is unmounted, ensuring no memory leaks or side effects.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
  window.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
    window.removeEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);
  };
}, [key1]);
```

This ensures the hook cleans up after itself and doesn't leave lingering event listeners after unmounting.

## Conclusion

The `useKeyCombination` hook is a simple and powerful way to add key combination detection to your React components, whether for shortcuts, accessibility features, or interactive experiences.
