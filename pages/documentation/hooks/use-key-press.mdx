# `useKeyPress` Hook

The `useKeyPress` hook allows you to detect when a specific key is pressed on the keyboard. This can be useful for triggering actions such as opening a search bar when the `/` key is pressed, or canceling an action when the `Escape` key is pressed.

## Features

- Detects when a specific key is pressed.
- Listens to both `keydown` and `keyup` events.
- Flexible and can be used with any key by passing its value as a parameter.

## Usage

Below is an example of how you can use the useKeyPress hook in your component:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useKeyPress } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const isSlashPressed = useKeyPress("/"); // Detects the "/" key
  const isEscapePressed = useKeyPress("Escape"); // Detects the "Escape" key

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        {isSlashPressed
          ? "Slash key is pressed!"
          : 'Press "/" to open search bar'}
      </p>
      <p>
        {isEscapePressed
          ? "Escape key is pressed!"
          : 'Press "Escape" to discard changes'}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Parameters

- **targetKey**: The key value that you want to detect when pressed. This is a required parameter and should be a valid [keyboard event key value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values). For example: `"Enter"`, `"Escape"`, `"/"`, `"ArrowUp"`, etc.

### Return Value

The `useKeyPress` hook returns a boolean value:

- `true` if the target key is currently being pressed.
- `false` if the target key is not pressed.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the hook to detect multiple key presses and perform actions based on those keys:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useKeyPress } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function KeyPressExample() {
  const isSlashPressed = useKeyPress("/"); // Detects the "/" key
  const isEscapePressed = useKeyPress("Escape"); // Detects the "Escape" key

  return (
    <div>
      {isSlashPressed && <p>Slash key is pressed! Open the search bar.</p>}
      {isEscapePressed && <p>Escape key is pressed! Discard changes.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default KeyPressExample;
```

## How It Works

The `useKeyPress` hook listens for both `keydown` and `keyup` events on the `window` object to detect whether a specific key is being pressed or not. When the specified key is pressed, it sets the state `keyPressed` to `true`, and when the key is released, it sets the state back to `false`.

The hook cleans up the event listeners when the component is unmounted to prevent memory leaks.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
  window.addEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
    window.removeEventListener("keyup", handleKeyUp);
  };
}, [targetKey]);
```

This ensures that the event listeners are properly registered and unregistered based on the targetKey.

### Example of Key Values

You can pass any valid key value to the hook to detect specific key presses. Here are a few examples:

```jsx
const isEnterPressed = useKeyPress("Enter"); // Detects "Enter" key
const isEscapePressed = useKeyPress("Escape"); // Detects "Escape" key
const isArrowUpPressed = useKeyPress("ArrowUp"); // Detects "ArrowUp" key
const isSlashPressed = useKeyPress("/"); // Detects "/" key
```

You can find the full list of key values [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values).

## Conclusion

The `useKeyPress` hook is a simple and powerful utility for detecting keyboard events in React applications. Whether you want to open a search bar, submit a form, or perform other actions based on key presses, this hook provides an easy and efficient way to handle key events.
