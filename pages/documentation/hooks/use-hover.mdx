# `useHover` Hook

The `useHover` hook provides an easy way to track whether an element is being hovered over by the user. This is especially useful for enhancing the user interface with hover-based interactions, such as tooltips, highlights, or animations.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through how to use the `useHover` hook in your React projects, including setup, usage, and an example implementation.

## Usage

The `useHover` hook is simple to use and returns two values:

1. **elementRef**: A ref that you attach to the DOM element you want to track.
2. **isHovered**: A boolean that indicates whether the element is currently being hovered.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `useHover` hook in a component:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useHover } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const [elementRef, isHovered] = useHover();

  return (
    <div ref={elementRef}>
      <p>{isHovered ? "Hover over element" : "Hover to check"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## How It Works

- **elementRef**: This ref is assigned to the DOM element (in this case, a `div`). It tells the hook which element to monitor for hover events.
- **isHovered**: This boolean is updated in real-time and reflects whether the user is currently hovering over the element.

Whenever the user hovers over the `div`, the text will update to "Hover over element." When the hover ends, the text changes back to "Hover to check."

## Hook Signature

The `useHover` hook follows this simple signature:

```ts
const [elementRef, isHovered] = useHover();
```

**Returns**: - **elementRef**: A React ref object that you attach to the element you want to track. - **isHovered**: A boolean value representing whether the element is currently being hovered over.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Attach the returned `elementRef` to any DOM element, and you'll instantly know when it's being hovered.
- **Real-time Updates**: The `isHovered` boolean updates in real-time, allowing for seamless hover state detection.
- **Lightweight**: The hook is lightweight, making it a perfect fit for small and large-scale applications alike.
- **Reusable**: You can use the `useHover` hook across multiple elements and components by creating separate instances.

This hook is ideal for tooltips, UI hover effects, and conditional rendering based on hover state.

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Hover Elements

You can track hover states for multiple elements by creating separate instances of the `useHover` hook for each element:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useHover } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function App() {
  const [hoverRef1, isHovered1] = useHover();
  const [hoverRef2, isHovered2] = useHover();

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={hoverRef1}>
        <p>{isHovered1 ? "Hovering over element 1" : "Hover over element 1"}</p>
      </div>
      <div ref={hoverRef2}>
        <p>{isHovered2 ? "Hovering over element 2" : "Hover over element 2"}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Styling Based on Hover State

You can dynamically change styles based on whether the element is being hovered:

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { useHover } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function HoverBox() {
  const [hoverRef, isHovered] = useHover();

  return (
    <div
      ref={hoverRef}
      style={{
        width: "200px",
        height: "200px",
        backgroundColor: isHovered ? "lightblue" : "lightgray",
        transition: "background-color 0.3s",
      }}
    >
      <p>{isHovered ? "Hovered!" : "Hover me!"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HoverBox;
```

In this example, the background color of the box changes when hovered over, and transitions smoothly using CSS.
