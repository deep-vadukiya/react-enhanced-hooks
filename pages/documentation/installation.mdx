# Installation

Installing **React Enhanced Hooks** is simple and quick. You can install it via npm or yarn and start using the hooks in your project immediately.

## Prerequisites

To use React Enhanced Hooks, you’ll need:

- **React**: v16.8 or higher, as hooks were introduced in React 16.8.
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.

## Install via NPM

To install the package via npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash copy
npm install react-enhanced-hooks
```

via pnpm

```bash copy
pnpm add react-enhanced-hooks
```

via yarn

```bash copy
yarn add react-enhanced-hooks
```

Once installed, you can start importing and using any of the hooks provided by the library in your React components.

## Basic Usage

Here’s how you can quickly get started with one of the hooks, such as useLocalStorage.

```js copy
import { useLocalStorage } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage("name", "John Doe");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Your name is: {name}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setName("Jane Doe")}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Peer Dependencies

React Enhanced Hooks relies on `react` and `react-dom`, which are already present in most React projects. Ensure you have them installed:

```js copy
pnpm add react react-dom
```

## TypeScript Support

If you're using TypeScript, React Enhanced Hooks is fully typed. Each hook comes with built-in types, so you’ll benefit from autocomplete and better tooling.

Here’s how you can get started with TypeScript:

```ts copy
import { useLocalStorage } from "react-enhanced-hooks";

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useLocalStorage<string>("key", "default value");

  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

The TypeScript types are inferred automatically, but you can explicitly set them if needed.

## Additional Setup for Custom Hooks

After installing the package, explore the documentation for specific hooks, including usage examples and advanced configurations.
